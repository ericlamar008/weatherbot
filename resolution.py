FIX LOG (this version -- resolution with network retry)

*** NEW FIX: TRANSIENT NETWORK FAILURES BLOCKING RESOLUTION ***
get_polymarket_settlement() used to make exactly ONE attempt to reach
gamma-api.polymarket.com. Any transient DNS hiccup or brief connection drop
(even with otherwise-healthy internet) caused an immediate "fetch error" and
a `None` return, which the caller (resolve_expired_markets in
weatherbot_v3.py) treats identically to "not settled yet" -- so the market
silently stayed unresolved until the NEXT full scan cycle happened to catch
it on a lucky attempt. This is what caused Jul 8-9 markets to resolve fine
while Jul 10 got stuck, even on a run where the internet connection was
confirmed healthy overall.

THE FIX: both get_polymarket_settlement() and is_event_fully_closed() now
retry up to MAX_RETRIES times with a short delay between attempts, using the
exact same retry pattern already used by forecasting.py's _fetch_ensemble()
(3 attempts, 3s delay) -- kept consistent rather than inventing a second
retry style. Only after all retries are exhausted does the function give up
and return None (still correctly distinguished from "event found but
nothing settled yet", which returns an empty dict).
